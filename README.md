# Coding Challenge

AmazingCo Coding Challenge

## Background

AmazingCo is a managed marketplace for experiences. We help our customers have unique and amazing experiences for everyday activities and special occasions. We operate across the United States, UK, Australia and New Zealand.

We need to build a technology platform to enable our vision.
Being a managed marketplace means our platform needs to not only help users discover and book experiences but also coordinate with friends and empower the supply side of our marketplace to deliver the experience with world-class results.

## Overview

We need to build a system so that people will be able to purchase our events online.

Our sales team have some new promotions they want to offer so we need to introduce a mechanism for applying discounts to orders.

Promotions like this can and will change over time so we need the solution to be flexible.

### Events

These are the events we are offering

| Events        | Cost          |
| ------------- |---------------|
| Kids Party    | $220          |
| Wine Tour     | $440          |
| Team Building | $800          |

- Not So Random Pty Ltd purchased 4 Wine Tour packages to Yarra Valley, based on the defined discounts the total should be $1320.00

### What we want from you

Provide a means of defining and applying various discounts to the cost of customers purchasing experiences from AmazingCo.

- We prefer that you create a private github repository for the test.
- You should focus on your area of strength and interest (Either C# or JavaSript Full-Stack). You have the freedom to complete the challenge your way.
- You should provide a copy of your code and include a readme detailing how to run your code as well as how you approached the problem, ideally, the code should be hosted in an online code repository.
- Please supply us with the URL to your solution as part of your application - you may choose to host your solution however you like, so long as we are able to access it.
- We're not too fussy about what platform your program runs on, but we do require that we're able to build and run your code ourselves.
